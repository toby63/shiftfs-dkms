## About

**Note:** 
- This version should be compatible with Linux Kernel versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x
- But the newest version is untested for now, the [commit for kernel 6.2](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/lunar/commit/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next&id=f9cf053b4ec48eeb438e26e75d847bad755765bf) might break support for 6.1, but it is not given. If it doesn't work, exclude that commit, e.g. with [git-revert](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-revert).

The **shiftfs.c** file is from the Ubuntu Lunar kernel repo (master-next branch), see: [git link](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/lunar/log/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next)

For an overview of shiftfs and more information see [README.md in master branch](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/blob/master/README.md).

## Known Issues

Upstream is warning about potential regressions, if shiftfs is
used with filesystem namespaces.

See: [commit](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/jammy/commit/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next&id=d347e71d2c0b4fc79891b00c47971f1ac5bd1ca8)

## Howto

### Install:

#### Requirements:
 * Required Linux Kernel version (see above)
 * dkms
 * kernel-headers (e.g. Debian package (for 64-bit): linux-headers-amd64)

#### 0. Check whether your kernel already includes shiftfs:

      # modinfo shiftfs

#### 1. Download this repo:
  
 With git:

      # git clone -b k6.1 https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms.git shiftfs-k61


#### 2. (Optional, but recommended) Update shiftfs.c:

 The shiftfs.c included might be outdated, thus the update-script.
 Check the [upstream log](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/lunar/log/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next) whether an update is available.

 Run as user:

      # ./update1


#### 3. Compile and install shiftfs with dkms:

 Run as root or with sudo:

       # make -f Makefile.dkms

 Now you can check again, whether shiftfs is activated:

       # modinfo shiftfs

### Uninstall/Remove:  

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1

### Upgrade:

**Note:** Check for updates regularly in the [upstream log](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/lunar/log/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next) for shiftfs and in the [Update log issue](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/12) for updates of this repo.
 
 * Uninstall/Remove the old version:

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1

 * (Optional) Update these scripts:
   
   _Note: Check the GitHub repo whether an update is necessary._
   
   Run as user (inside the scripts folder):
       
       # git pull origin master
 
 * Repeat Step 2. and 3.
